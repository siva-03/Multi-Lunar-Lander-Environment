# Multi-Lunar-Lander-Environment

This is my course project for CSCI 7000 - Deep Reinforcement Learning for Robotics in Fall 2023 at University of Colorado Boulder.
Our work creates a multi-agent lunar lander environment akin to the OpenAI lunar lander following the PettingZoo API. We have evaluated the environment we built
successfully on a number of compliance tests that PettingZoo provides. We implemented agents using Deep QNetworks and evaluated their performance in our environment.
